# Vega-Embed v2

[Vega-Embed](https://github.com/vega/vega-embed) for Vega 2 and Vega-Lite 1. This is an old package and we created this placeholder for cases where you need to import multiple versions of Vega-Embed. 

**Only use this if you know what you're doing. Otherwise, you probably want to use `vega-embed`!**
